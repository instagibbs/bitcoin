# Private broadcast

Bitcoin Core can send a transaction to the network without revealing your IP address, onion address
or node identity, either with the standalone `bitcoin-privbcast` program or with
`bitcoind -privatebroadcast`, which runs the same jobs for transactions submitted through
`sendrawtransaction` and `submitpackage`. Each broadcast is a job: it finds peers through the
release DNS seeds (resolved through Tor) and the built-in onion seeds, connects to a small, fixed
number of them through Tor on a schedule drawn when the job starts, announces the transaction, and
stops. A job does not retry.

What a job guarantees, and what it does not, is specified in
[design/private-broadcast-tool.md](design/private-broadcast-tool.md).

## Tor proxy

Jobs reach everything through a Tor SOCKS5 proxy.

- `bitcoin-privbcast` expects Tor at `127.0.0.1:9050`. Use `-tor=<ip:port|path>` for another
  loopback address or a unix socket; a remote proxy is refused, because SOCKS5 carries
  destinations and credentials in plaintext.
- `bitcoind -privatebroadcast` uses the node's Tor proxy, set with `-proxy`, `-onion`, or
  `-listenonion` with `-torcontrol` (see [tor.md](tor.md)).

The proxy must accept SOCKS username/password authentication and Tor's RESOLVE extension. Without
IPv6 it loses the IPv6 peers. A proxy that is not Tor delivers nothing: every stream uses fresh
credentials, which `ssh -D` and most VPN clients do not accept, and IPv4 and IPv6 peers come only
from RESOLVE answers.

If the node and the jobs share a SocksPort, keep Tor's default `IsolateSOCKSAuth`. With
`NoIsolateSOCKSAuth`, Tor may put several of a job's streams on one circuit, so one exit could see
the transaction reach several peers, or put a job's stream on a circuit that also carries the node's
own connections. Nothing at the SOCKS interface can detect this.

## bitcoin-privbcast

1. Check the transaction with `bitcoin-cli testmempoolaccept`. The tool only checks that the
   transaction is well formed, standard in size, and burns nothing to an unspendable output
   (`-maxburnamount` raises that limit).
2. Feed the final hex on stdin, choosing the chain as with other tools (`-signet`, `-testnet4`, ...):
   ```
   bitcoin-privbcast send < tx.hex
   ```
   The JSON report goes to stdout and progress lines to stderr.
3. Watch for the transaction with `bitcoin-cli getmempoolentry <txid>`. Do not also broadcast it the
   ordinary way. If it does not arrive, run another job.

`send` exits with status 0 if the announcement was fully sent to at least one peer, 2 if it reached
none, and 1 on bad input or arguments, or an internal error. Status 0 does not mean that a peer
requested, received or accepted the transaction: the report's per-attempt `outcome` and its
`tx_written` and `pongs` counts say more. The report and the progress lines name the transaction and
every peer dialled, so keep them where you would keep a wallet log. Progress lines carry timestamps,
like `debug.log`, while the report gives times as offsets from the job's start. Progress lines are
best effort: on a pipe or a file, a line that stderr cannot take at once is dropped, while a paused
terminal holds the job up until the line is written.

`bitcoin-privbcast discover` runs only the peer discovery and prints the candidates it found. It
makes the same queries as a job.

## A parent and its child

A parent too cheap to enter mempools on its own can be carried by a child that pays for both, if
the recipient evaluates the two together. Give the tool both transactions, separated by whitespace,
in either order. The job announces the child and serves the parent to a peer that asks for it.

- Bitcoin Core 31 and later accept a parent below the minimum relay feerate in such a package
  whatever its version; versions 28 to 30 only if it is TRUC (version 3); older versions drop it.
  Whether the package reaches miners depends on what they run.
- `testmempoolaccept` checks each transaction on its own. It rejects a low-fee parent ("min relay
  fee not met", or "mempool min fee not met") even when the package would be accepted, and then does
  not evaluate the child. The tool checks no fees, so work out the package feerate yourself. The
  node checks the pair's feerate (see below), but nothing else about such a child.
- Peers can tell that you used package mode: a peer that fetches the child sees the job wait before
  its PING, and a peer that asks for the parent is sent it. That the two transactions belong
  together is visible on chain anyway.

## bitcoind -privatebroadcast

With `-privatebroadcast`, `sendrawtransaction` and `submitpackage` queue a job instead of adding the
transaction to the mempool and announcing it to the node's peers. The transaction enters the node's
mempool only when it comes back from the network, and is then relayed like any other. Wallet sends
are not affected: the wallet adds to the mempool and rebroadcasts from there.

- `sendrawtransaction` test-accepts the transaction, then queues it. `submitpackage` takes one
  transaction, or one parent and its child. A transaction whose txid is already in the mempool
  counts as accepted and is sent as you gave it. A new parent too cheap on its own goes out with its
  child, which must then stay within `maxfeerate`, and the pair must meet the mempool's minimum
  feerate.
- Jobs start in submission order, 35 to 55 seconds (drawn at random) after the previous start. A
  job submitted after that time, with nothing waiting, starts at once.
- A transaction whose job is still queued or running is not queued again. The match is by wtxid, so
  a witness variant gets its own job. A job for a parent and child also covers the child submitted
  alone, once the parent is in the mempool; before that, `sendrawtransaction` refuses the child for
  its missing input. Once a job has ended, the same transaction can be queued again.
- A job runs until its schedule is over, at most ten minutes, and does not retry. If
  `getprivatebroadcastinfo` shows a finished job with `announced` false, or the transaction does not
  arrive, submit it again.
- `getprivatebroadcastinfo` lists the queued and running jobs and the last 100 finished ones, with
  their reports, which include every peer dialled, to any RPC user allowed to call it. They are
  kept in memory only.
  `abortprivatebroadcast` removes a queued job or stops a running one.
- `setnetworkactive false` and shutdown cancel all jobs; turning networking back on does not restart
  them. While networking is off, submissions are refused.
- Settings that choose the node's peers (`-onlynet`, `-dnsseed`, `-fixedseeds`, `-connect`,
  `-seednode`, `-addnode`) do not apply to jobs, except that `-privatebroadcast` is refused at
  startup when `-onlynet` leaves out onion. Even with `-onlynet=onion`, jobs connect to IPv4 and
  IPv6 peers through Tor exits. Every proxy stream uses fresh credentials, whatever
  `-proxyrandomize` says.
- `debug.log` records job progress only with `-debug=privatebroadcast`, and SOCKS failures that name
  a destination only with `-debug=proxy` or `-debug=net`. By default it names no transaction or
  peer.
- Jobs need file descriptors beyond those of the node's ordinary connections. If the node refuses to
  start for lack of them, lower `-maxconnections`.

## Limits

- The onion seeds are built into the binary and age with it: about half of a list's onions still
  answer six months after it is generated, and about one in eight after a year. With an old
  release, most onion attempts fail and delivery rests on the peers reached through Tor exits.
- A peer can accept the announcement and then withhold the transaction, and the job does not try
  that slot again. Watch for the transaction and submit it again if it does not arrive.
- Tor exits and DNS seeds are untrusted: an exit can act as the peer on its own connection, and a
  seed can lie about which peers exist. Each affects only its share of a job's connections.
- Peers can recognise the tool by its fixed profile. They learn only that someone used it.
- The tool and the node usually share a host and a Tor daemon, and the design does not separate
  them.
- The wallet is out of scope. If a wallet loaded in your node recognises the transaction, then once
  the transaction is back in the node's mempool, the wallet's periodic resend (every 12 to 36 hours)
  announces it to all of the node's peers for as long as it stays unconfirmed, however it was first
  broadcast. To avoid that, run the node with `-walletbroadcast=0` or keep the wallet on another
  node.
- Stopping the node or running `setnetworkactive false` closes a job's open connections at nearly
  the same moment the node drops its own peers. A peer of your node that is also one of the job's
  recipients could link the two.
- Tor does not protect against an observer who watches both your connection to Tor and the Bitcoin
  network. The burst of circuits a job opens when it starts makes it easier to spot.
