/** A potential BIP331 Ancestor Package, i.e. one transaction with its set of ancestors.
 * This class does not have any knowledge of chainstate, so it cannot determine whether all
 * unconfirmed ancestors are present. Its constructor accepts any list of transactions that
 * IsConsistent(), linearizes them topologically, and determines whether it IsAncestorPackage().
 * If fee and vsizes are given for each transaction, it can also linearize the transactions using
 * the ancestor score-based mining algorithm via MiniMiner.
 *
 * Skip() and SkipWithDescendants() can be used to omit transactions. Txns() returns all
 * transactions linearized, and FilteredTxns() is the same but excludes the skipped ones.
 * GetAncestorSet() can be used to get a transaction's "subpackage," i.e. ancestor set within the
 * package, also excluding skipped ones.
