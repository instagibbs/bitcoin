 * proxy, each on its own stream with its own credentials, all launched at job start (D1, R1).
 * A query whose stream cannot be started is skipped; one whose stream fails ends without an
 * answer. An answer counts only if it arrives before the discovery window ends, and is usable
 * only as a public routable IPv4 or IPv6 address, which gets the chain's default port (R2).
 * Discovery ends when every query has ended or when the window ends, whatever is pending (C3).
 *
 * Like the attempts, it reads no clock: the job's loop passes the plan clock's offset from job
 * start and the I/O clock with every call, and waits on ActiveStreams().
