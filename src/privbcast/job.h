 *
 * The plan is drawn at construction, before any socket exists (C1), and job start is read then
 * unless the inputs give it. Discovery starts with the first Step(); delivery starts at the end of
 * the discovery window, with the candidates fixed when discovery ended (C2, C3). The slots run side
 * by side on one non-blocking event loop (C7), each dialling its opportunities at their scheduled
 * times (C4-C6). The job ends with its last slot (D2).
 *
 * An exception thrown while the loop acts on one attempt or one discovery query ends only that
 * attempt or query, as a failure of its stream would (C7). One thrown anywhere else in a step fails
 * the job: it stops as a cancelled one does, and its report gives the error (H2).
 *
 * Its only effects are on sockets made through CreateSock to the proxy (A3, B1). The plan clock
 * is NodeClock: the schedule, the deadlines and the report's times, which are offsets from the
 * reading taken at job start (H1). The I/O clock, MockableSteadyClock, times the proxy streams.
